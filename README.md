## Overview

![screenshot](https://blissful-kalam-32f897.netlify.app/images/main_home.jpeg)

Introduce your projects by taking a screenshot or a gif. Try to tell visitors a story about your project by answering:

- Demo : https://blissful-kalam-32f897.netlify.app
- Learn: Svelte transitions, data communication between components and etc.
- Build to learn that is the easiest way to master something.

### Built With

<!-- This section should list any major frameworks that you built your project using. Here are a few examples.-->

- [Svelte](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/)

## Features

<!-- List the features of your application or follow the template. Don't share the figma file here :) -->

This application/site was created as a submission to a [DevChallenges](https://devchallenges.io/challenges) challenge. The [challenge](https://devchallenges.io/challenges/ohgVTyJCbm5OZyTB2gNY) was to build an application to complete the given user stories.

## How To Use

<!-- This is an example, please update according to your application -->

To clone and run this application, you'll need [Git](https://git-scm.com) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (which comes with [npm](http://npmjs.com)) installed on your computer. From your command line:

```bash
# Clone this repository
$ git clone https://github.com/your-user-name/your-project-name

# Install dependencies
$ npm install

# Run the app
$ npm run dev
```

## Building

Before creating a production version of your app, install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs#adapters) for your target environment. Then:

```bash
npm run build
```

> You can preview the built app with `npm run preview`, regardless of whether you installed an adapter. This should _not_ be used to serve your app in production.
